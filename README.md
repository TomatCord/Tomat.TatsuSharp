# Tomat.TatsuSharp
Tatsumaki wrapper in C# for .NET. Adapated from the official [Golang wrapper](https://github.com/tatsuworks/tatsu-api-go).

## Using
Usage is incredibly simple. All you need to do is add the assembly as an assembly reference (fetch the latest release from the Releases page), initialize a `TatsuClient` with your API key, and do honestly whatever.
